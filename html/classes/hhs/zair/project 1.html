    <title> My favorite athlete</title>
    <body id="body">
    <h1 id="title"> Lionel Messi</h1>
    <h2 id="body2">Messi is one of the best FIFA players in the world </h2>
     <h2> Accomplishments and reasons why he is great 
        </h2> 
        <ul>    
    <li> Messi went to Barcelona since he was a kid because they saw he had talent </li> 
    <li> Multiple times voted best soccer player of the year </li>
    <li> Barcelona's all-time top-scorer: 513 and counting </li>

</ul>
<p id="p1"> The Reason I chose Lionel Messi as my athlete is becuase I like the team he's on and i'm facinated by how well he plays<br> and how many goals he scores amd how many assit he can make and still be a top scorer <br>plus he is very small and that doesn't stop him of being the best in the world.<br> Lionel Messi is one of the best soccer players that there will ever be when he retires he will be a legend. <br>He will also be one of Argentina's best players ever.
